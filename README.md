### Overall Description of project
Project is written using React - Typescript, Javascript.
The loop application is devided to components: Looper, ChannelList, Channel, ProgressBar, Buttons...
I created a page holding 9 Channels (as ChannelList),
each Channel (different colored) is an audio loop which can be muted using the mute button next to it.
a white progressBar (width 1px) representing current time of the audios which can be dragged and dropped by the user to
different locations of the audio file.
the bottom section contain buttons for play, pause, stop and loop. and right next to it the current time of the audio.
